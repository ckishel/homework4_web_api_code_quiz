# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## Mock-Up

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

![A user clicks through an interactive coding quiz, then enters initials to save the high score before resetting and starting over. My resulting homework submission is a bit more simplistic, with an interactive coding quiz, without the ability to save a high score or a timer. It is dynamic and has sections that respond dynamically to input. It is responsive to click events and and gets Element by ID. It does not have a timer or save the high score, but displays the functionality of a quiz application using javascript.](./Assets/quiz-start.jpg)(./Assets/first-question.jpg)
